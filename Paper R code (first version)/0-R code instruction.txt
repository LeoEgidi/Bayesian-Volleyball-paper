## INTRO

In the interests of transparency and reproducibility, this folder contains all the readable R code required to 
replicate the results and the plots of the paper "A Bayesian Quest for Finding a Unified Model for Predicting
Volleyball Games", by Leonardo Egidi (University of Trieste) and Ioannis Ntzoufras (Athens University of Economics and Business).

## DATA DESCRIPTION

Data about the Italian SuperLega 2017/2018 are contained in the file "Regular_season_2017-18_Set_by_set_Ita.csv", whereas data about
the playoff phase of the Italian SuperLega are contained in the file "playoff_season_2017-18_ita.csv". Each row is a measurement
for a given team in a given match. The files contain the following columns names:

 - day : match day
 - team: team names
 - set: number of match sets
 - set1, set2, set3, set4, set5: number of points for each set (blank cell if the set has not been played)


## HOW TO RUN THE CODE

Each R file is numbered with respect to the section where the code is used. For instance, the random effect models in Section 3.2 is 
renamed in the following way: "3.2-<model_name>.R", and so on.
The file "macro.R" is the main file used to launch all the code. The user can use the "Source" command in the RStudio consolle to
run the models and replicate all the results. 
The file "volley_ita.R" contains all the data acquisition and data cleaning procedures.


## NOTES

The code relies on JAGS software. So, install JAGS on your laptop before running the code. The list of required packages is included 
at the beginning of the "macro.R" file.
